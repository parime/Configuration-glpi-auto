## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-10

First real release. Nothing before this tag ever installed — see the historical note below.

### Sprint 2 — Entity structure settings (2026-08-10)

#### Added
- `Config` (`src/Config.php`): plugin-wide settings screen (Configuration > Plugins > wrench
  icon), a single settings row. First setting: the entity structure the future entity-creation
  wizard will build — mono-entité, multi-entité (same company), or multi-entité (MSP managing
  several client companies) — with a configurable number of sub-entity levels (up to 5) and a
  label per level. Does not create any `Entity` yet; only records the shape for the wizard.
- `front/config.php` + `templates/config_form.html.twig`: settings form (Bootstrap
  card/form-check style, same visual language as remise-glpi/glpi-vulnerability-manager) with a
  live, client-side tree preview that re-renders on every change (mode switch, level count,
  level labels) with no page reload or server round-trip — validated interactively with
  Playwright against a real GLPI 11.0.8 instance.
- `Profile::RIGHT_CONFIG` (`plugin_configurationglpiauto_config`): dedicated right for this
  settings screen, granted to Super-Admin by default, same registration pattern as
  `RIGHT_PROFILE`.

### Note on the [1.0.0] entry below

The `[1.0.0] - 2026-08-07` entry that used to be here described a fully-featured release. It did
not correspond to the actual state of the repository: on 2026-08-10 the codebase consisted almost
entirely of documentation and CI scaffolding — `composer.json` referenced non-existent packages,
`phpstan.neon` pointed at files that didn't exist, and every class referenced by `setup.php` /
`hook.php` beyond a handful was never written, making the plugin impossible to install. Sprint 1
(below) rebuilds real, validated foundations from that point. The entry is kept below, relabeled,
for history rather than deleted outright.

### Sprint 1 — Infra & first real entity (2026-08-10)

#### Added
- Real plugin bootstrap (`setup.php`/`hook.php`) following the modern GLPI 11 plugin functions
  convention (`plugin_init_*`, `plugin_version_*`, `plugin_*_install/uninstall`,
  `plugin_*_check_prerequisites/check_config`), validated against a real GLPI 11.0.8 instance.
- `ConfigurationProfile` (`src/ConfigurationProfile.php`): the first real, working entity — a
  catalog of predefined configuration profiles (Installation minimale, PME, ETI, Grande
  entreprise, MSP, ISO 27001, ITIL, Personnalisé), with full CRUD (list, add, edit, delete) via
  `front/profile.php` / `front/profile.form.php`.
- `Installer` (`src/Install/Installer.php`): creates the plugin's schema and seeds the eight
  default profiles on install; drops it cleanly on uninstall.
- `Profile` (`src/Profile.php`): registers a dedicated `plugin_configurationglpiauto_profile`
  right in GLPI's standard profile matrix, granted to Super-Admin by default.
- `docker-compose.test.yml`: local GLPI + MariaDB stack for manual/CI-independent validation.

#### Fixed
- `composer.json` referenced `glpi-project/glpi` (not a real Packagist package — GLPI core is
  provided by the host instance, not a Composer dependency) and mis-named/irrelevant dev tooling
  (`rectorphp/rector`, `php-compatibility/php-compatibility`, `nunomaduro/larastan` — a Laravel
  tool with no relevance to a GLPI plugin). Fixed to only require what actually resolves.
- `phpstan.neon` included a non-existent stub file and a non-existent
  `vendor/glpi-project/tools/phpstan/glpi.php`. Rescoped to GLPI-independent code only (none
  exists yet, same constraint documented on the sibling glpi-vulnerability-manager plugin), and
  the CI workflow's PHPStan step updated to match.
- Namespacing the profile entity under `...\Entity\ConfigurationProfile` triggered GLPI's
  automatic table-name derivation to treat the `Entity` segment as GLPI's own core `Entity`
  class, producing a bogus many-to-many relation table name
  (`glpi_plugin_configurationglpiauto_entities_configurationprofiles`) instead of
  `..._profiles`, and fatally breaking install. Fixed by flattening the namespace and overriding
  `getTable()` explicitly — same lesson already documented on glpi-vulnerability-manager.
- Reusing GLPI's core `config` right for the profile CRUD screens 403'd on "Ajouter" for the
  built-in super-admin: `config` only ever grants READ/UPDATE (it models a per-entity singleton),
  never CREATE/PURGE. Fixed by introducing a dedicated plugin right (see `Profile` above).
- The `itemlink` search-option datatype on the profile's `name` column resolves its target
  itemtype via a reverse table-name lookup (`getItemTypeForTable()`), which fails for any class
  with a manually-overridden `getTable()` (see above) — surfaced as a 500
  (`Class name must be a valid object or a string` in `SQLProvider::giveItem()`). Fixed by
  declaring `itemtype` explicitly in the search option instead of relying on the reverse lookup.
